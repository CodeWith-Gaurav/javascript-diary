# 📘 Day 1 - Data Types, Typecasting, Hoisting, Conditionals & Loops

On Day 1 of my JavaScript journey, I explored some foundational concepts that are essential for writing dynamic and interactive code. Here's a summary of what I learned:

## ✅ Topics Covered

### 🟩 JavaScript Data Types

JavaScript has two main categories of data types:

#### 🔹 Primitive Data Types
- **Number** – Handles all numeric values, including decimals.
- **String** – Represents text, enclosed in single or double quotes.
- **Boolean** – Represents `true` or `false`.
- **undefined** – A variable declared but not assigned any value.
- **null** – Represents an empty or non-existent value.
- **Symbol** – Used for creating unique identifiers.
- **BigInt** – Used for very large numbers beyond the safe integer range.

#### 🔸 Reference Data Types
- **Array** – A list of values.
- **Object** – A collection of key-value pairs.
- **Function** – A block of reusable code.

### 🔁 Typecasting and User Input

- Learned that `prompt()` returns string values, even if numbers are entered.
- Used **typecasting** with `Number()` to convert input from strings to numbers for correct arithmetic operations.

---

### 🚀 Hoisting

- Understood JavaScript's behavior of **hoisting**, where variable declarations using `var` are moved to the top of their scope.
- Realized that using `let` or `const` before declaration results in errors due to the temporal dead zone.

---

### 🧠 Conditionals

- Practiced `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.
- Used conditionals for logic-based operations such as checking voting eligibility and calculating electricity bills.

---

### 🔍 Comparison Operators

- `==` checks **value** only (performs type coercion).
- `===` checks **both value and data type** (strict equality).

---

### 🎯 Ternary Operator

- Learned how to write compact `if-else` logic using the ternary operator.

---

### 🔄 Loops

- Introduced to the `while` loop and its basic syntax.
- Understood the potential for infinite loops if conditions are not properly controlled.

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- JavaScript supports both primitive and reference types for flexible data handling.
- Always typecast `prompt()` inputs when working with numbers.
- Be cautious with hoisting and understand the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Conditional logic and comparisons are vital for decision-making in code.
- Ternary operators offer a shorthand way to write conditionals.
- Loops must be managed carefully to avoid infinite execution.
