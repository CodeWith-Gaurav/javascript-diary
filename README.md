# 🚀 JavaScript Learning Journey from Scratch

Welcome to my JavaScript learning diary! 📚✨  
This repository is a personal log of my daily progress as I learn JavaScript from the very basics, one day at a time.

Each folder inside this repo corresponds to a **Day** in my learning path, starting from `Day 0`, and will contain:
- My practice code
- Key concepts I learned that day
- Notes or explanations as I go along

## 📅 Timeline
| Day | Topics Covered | Folder |
|-----|----------------|--------|
| 0   | Console, Variables, Prompt, Confirm | [Day 0](/Day_0) |

Stay tuned for more updates as I level up my JavaScript skills!
